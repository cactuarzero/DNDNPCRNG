Need only be in the players possession.-A small square metal container with d10+5 strange brass cylinders, about a centimetre wide and less than three long. One end of the cylinder is closed, the base encrypted with unknown insignia around a grey round spot in the middle. On the other end there is a small, ball like metal piece.

By holding the shell up to their ear, the holder can hear rushing water and violent waves with an unusual degree of clarity. Continuing to listen the shell causes the holder to slowly begin to experience sensations of seasickness and a pressure similar to being too deep underwater.

The whispering continues to grow louder while the sensations escalate, until the whispers can almost be made out, at which point the holder falls unconscious for an hour.-A singular, tattered playing card with a very faded face side. When shuffled into a deck being used for a game, it is frequently drawn in the owner’s opening hand, with the face side of a valuable card for whichever game is being played.

When pulled from the deck, the card is in it’s normal, faded state.-A rather large iron pot covered in scratches and scorch marks that can’t seem to be taken off. Meals prepared by this pot are always palatable but in need of salt, regardless of whether the recipe called for salt, the consumer’s enjoyment of salt, or amount of salt that was used in the cooking.

When you pour a liquid into it, it spits it out and then screams the name of whatever liquid was in it.
